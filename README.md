Modern Next.js app with email+password auth, Prisma + SQLite, QR membership, cash activation, check-in scanner, responsive UI.

## Quick start

5. Seed an admin user (see below) or register and flip role in DB.
6. `npm run dev` then open http://localhost:3000

### Make an admin
- Open `npx prisma studio`, find your user and set `role` to `ADMIN`.
- Or run a one-liner:
  ```bash
  npx prisma db execute --file ./scripts/make-admin.sql
  ```

### Cash activation flow
- User registers on /register
- You receive cash, go to /admin and mark membership Active and set expiry date
- At entrance use /scan to read their QR and auto check-in

### Production tips
- Switch SQLite to Postgres by changing DATABASE_URL and running `npm run prisma:push`
- Put the app on Vercel or any Node host
- Use a USB or phone camera for /scan station at the entrance

### Logo
